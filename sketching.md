bomb attempts

place to put in log
tries to get demo for that log...
if it can, parse it
then return the results

(EASIER SAID THAN DONE)

bascially explain the bomb efficiency graph, how it is calculated
(
taking every rocket jump event,
compute the players nearest,
if players are close to the land then start recording,
record damage and kills within 3 seconds of landing
)

show the graph
have a button to put in a demo id (then analyze the demo)

and display on the graph with a plot against invite players
