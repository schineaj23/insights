# TODO LIST
- Get list of all players (invite & advanced) 
- Get ONLY SCRIM logs, (make sure that the core players are on the same team, around scrim times) after end of season, so data is recent
- Ensure no duplicates

Later
- Put into DB, (find DB to use start learning it)
- Extract insights, predicting who will win by round, etc
- Generate power rankings

Very Long down the road...
- Real-time score prediction/round prediction based on current gamestate 
  (would need to parse demos for this data)
